abstract="The Voronoi diagram of a finite set of objects is a fundamental geometric structure that subdivides the embedding space into regions, each region consisting of the points that are closer to a given object than to the others. We may define various variants of Voronoi diagrams depending on the class of objects, the distance function and the embedding space. In this paper, we investigate a framework for defining and building Voronoi diagrams for a broad class of distance functions called Bregman divergences. Bregman divergences include not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various divergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi diagrams allow one to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical parametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define several types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those diagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them efficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g., k-order and k-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set of points and their connection with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these triangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay triangulation.",

abstract = {Despite investigations for over 70 years, the absolute limits of human vision have remained unclear. Rod cells respond to individual photons, yet whether a single-photon incident on the eye can be perceived by a human subject has remained a fundamental open question. Here we report that humans can detect a single-photon incident on the cornea with a probability significantly above chance. This was achieved by implementing a combination of a psychophysics procedure with a quantum light source that can generate single-photon states of light. We further discover that the probability of reporting a single photon is modulated by the presence of an earlier photon, suggesting a priming process that temporarily enhances the effective gain of the visual system on the timescale of seconds.},

abstract = {Indirect illumination is an important element for realistic image synthesis, but its computation is expensive and highly dependent on the complexity of the scene and of the BRDF of the involved surfaces. While off‐line computation and pre‐baking can be acceptable for some cases, many applications (games, simulators, etc.) require real‐time or interactive approaches to evaluate indirect illumination. We present a novel algorithm to compute indirect lighting in real‐time that avoids costly precomputation steps and is not restricted to low‐frequency illumination. It is based on a hierarchical voxel octree representation generated and updated on the fly from a regular scene mesh coupled with an approximate voxel cone tracing that allows for a fast estimation of the visibility and incoming energy. Our approach can manage two light bounces for both Lambertian and glossy materials at interactive framerates (25–70FPS). It exhibits an almost scene‐independent performance and can handle complex scenes with dynamic content thanks to an interactive octree‐voxelization scheme. In addition, we demonstrate that our voxel cone tracing can be used to efficiently estimate Ambient Occlusion.},

abstract = {<p><p>Shadowing has historically been used to increase the intelligibility of scenes in electron microscopy and aerial survey. Various methods have been published for the determination of shadows in computer synthesized scenes. The display of shadows may make the shape and relative position of objects in such scenes more comprehensible; it is a technique lending vividness and realism to computer animation.</p> <p>To date, algorithms for the determination of shadows have been restricted to scenes constructed of planar polygons. A simple algorithm is described which utilizes Z-buffer visible surface computation to display shadows cast by objects modelled of smooth surface patches. The method can be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces can be computed. The cost of determining the shadows associated with each light source is roughly twice the cost of rendering the scene without shadows, plus a fixed transformation overhead which depends on the image resolution. No extra entities are added to the scene description in the shadowing process. This comprehensive algorithm, which permits curved shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted with a less costly method for casting the shadows of the environment on a single ground plane.</p> <p>In order to attain good results, the discrete nature of the visible-surface computations must be treated with care. The effects of dither, interpolation, and geometric quantization at different stages of the shadowing algorithm are examined. The special problems posed by self-shadowing surfaces are described.</p></p>},

abstract = {Light propagation volumes is a real-time single bounce indirect lighting approximation that uses spherical harmonics for light representation and a grid-based light transport. The technique is useful for applying indirect light to participating media, glossy specular reflection, and indirect diffuse illumination, but this thesis focuses on the indirect diffuse illumination. When applying indirect diffuse light, the light propagation volume method has issues with light bleeding, self lighting, and surface lighting artifacts. Also, when the indirect diffuse lighting is applied to more complex geometry, there is a lack of directional influence in the shading, producing a flat lighting effect, uncharacteristic of diffuse shading. I modify the light propagation volume approach by extending the spherical harmonics from two bands to three bands and describe a higher order propagation approach that considers 26 directions of propagation versus the original six. The new resulting technique is called higher order light propagation volumes. Higher order light propagation volumes are able to combat some of the problems present with light propagation volumes. The new technique reduces the appearance of lighting artifacts, and at the same time promotes a light distribution in scenes that resembles reference implementations, such as path tracing. Lastly, indirect diffuse illumination applied with the new technique produces higher quality diffuse shading detail because the directional representation of light is better preserved with the combination of extended spherical harmonics light representation and the higher order propagation method},

It augments screen-door transparency using a random sub-pixel stipple pattern, where each fragment of transparent geometry covers a random subset of pixel samples of size proportional to alpha. This results in correct alpha-blended colors on average, in a single render pass with fixed memory size and no sorting, but introduces noise. We reduce this noise by an alpha correction pass, and by an accumulation pass that uses a stochastic shadow map from the camera. At the pixel level, the algorithm does not branch and contains no read-modify-write loops, other than traditional z-buffer blend operations. This makes it an excellent match for modern massively parallel GPU hardware. Stochastic transparency is very simple to implement and supports all types of transparent geometry, able without coding for special cases to mix hair, smoke, foliage, windows, and transparent cloth in a single scene.},
